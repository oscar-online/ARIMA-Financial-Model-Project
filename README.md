Within this folder is my work towards developing a web app to fit, test and simulate backtested strategies using statistical analysis models.

Considered models will be:

- ARMA(p,q)
- ARIMA(p,d,q)
- GARCH
- MGARCH

Primarily I am using Python, HTML and CSS

At the current stage I have developed a python framework for selecting data, applying, fiting and backtesting a strategy with ARMA and ARIMA models.

Ahead, the task is to mirror this approach with other mathematical models, and develop the front end.

I have included ipynb and py files, along with a script file (in case of errors displaying my files) to demonstrate the current status of my project.
